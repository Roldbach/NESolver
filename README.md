> **Abstract**<br>
> **Background and Objective** The vulnerability to cross-ion interference has
> impeded the practical application of ion-selective electrodes. Such cross-
> selectivity is difficult to model and has yet to be fundamentally resolved. We
> aim to develop a computational tool to address the cross-selectivity of ion-
> selective electrodes.<br>
>
> **Methods** The proposed tool, namely NESolver, is a chemistry-informed tool
> for multivariate ion analysis with ion-selective electrodes. It enables precise
> sensor characteristic quantification and accurate ion concentration inference
> based on the contributions of all present ions in the sample.  The underlying
> computation is enhanced by techniques stemming from theoretical and empirical
> chemical knowledge, ensuring the practical applicability of the tool. A highly
> automated pipeline and an informative text-based user interface have been
> implemented to streamline usage for individuals with various levels of
> technical expertise.<br>
>
> **Results** We validated the effectiveness of NESolver by benchmarking its
> performance against existing numerical methods on synthetic samples with
> diverse composition, demonstrating its marginal superiority in terms of both
> accuracy and chemical interpretability. By replicating the procedure under
> different experimental conditions, we also showcased the capability of NESolver
> to infer ion concentration beyond the calibration range and robustness to noise.<br>
>
> **Conclusions** NESolver has shown promising potential as an easy-to-use and
> chemically interpretable tool for multivariate ion analysis, despite its
> current performance limitations on samples with complex composition. Future
> work will focus on enhancing its modelling capability for intricate cross-ion
> interference and validating its performance on real samples.<br>
